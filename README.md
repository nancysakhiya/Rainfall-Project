/Rainfall analysis project

This project uses Python to analyze rainfall data. The primary goal is exploring, cleaning, and analyzing rainfall data to uncover trends and insights.

This project involves Python libraries such as Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

This analysis aims to uncover long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in India’s rainfall data. We will examine historical rainfall trends, detect years with extreme or deficient rainfall, explore relationships between seasonal and annual rainfall, and forecast future rainfall using time series models. For this analysis, we rely on a dataset containing monthly, seasonal, and yearly rainfall measurements spanning over a century. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which includes monthly rainfall values, seasonal aggregations (e.g., monsoon rainfall), and annual totals, all essential for understanding variability, detecting anomalies, and predicting future trends. I have used the data set from the link given here: https://statso.io/rainfall-trends-in-india-case-study/

This project covers various topics, such as Analyzing Annual Rainfall Trends Over Time, Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Rainfall Trends in India, Detecting Anomalies in Rainfall Trends in India, Relating Seasonal Rainfall with Annual Totals, Grouping Years Based on Rainfall Patterns, and Forecasting Future Rainfallc.

In conclusion, The analysis of India’s rainfall trends and patterns from 1901 to 2015 reveals significant variability in annual and seasonal rainfall, with the monsoon season (June-September) being the dominant contributor. Anomalous years of extreme drought and wetness highlight the unpredictability of rainfall, while clustering shows a shift towards more dry years in recent decades. Correlations indicate the limited dependency of non-monsoon seasons on monsoon rainfall. A time-series forecast using Prophet suggests a slight declining trend in annual rainfall, which emphasizes the need for long-term water resource planning and adaptation to changing climate patterns.

I have attached a Google document here, where the graphs and more analysis of every graph are mentioned in a detailed explanation.
